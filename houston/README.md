# Documentation for Houston 

**Tech Stack (Official)**
- Frontend: raw HTML/CSS (not final)
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- DB: SQLite
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4
- Communication with car: RFD900, STM32 (STM32 script not in this repo)

**File & Folder Overview**
- *database.db*: the working database of the server. Used to store aggregated
  sensor readings. **DO NOT MANUALLY MODIFY THIS UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!**
- *app.py*: flask app script that hosts the webapp, initializes the SQLite
  database, and (tentatively) defines several relevant routes.
- templates: directory that stores the HTML files for our webpages
    - *index.html*: the "main" webpage for houston. Displays critical sensor
      information.
- static: directory that stores style sheets (CSS) to decorate HTML pages
    - *style.css*: see above
- test: directory that stores test files to use throughout development of
  houston
    - *database-feeder.py*: feeds sample data into the database
    - *serial-demo.py*: feeds mock (randomized) 
- *requirements.txt*: Python/pip dependency file that names libraries for Docker
  to install
- *Dockerfile*: Docker compilation file for houston

> NOTE: the app will attempt to run on port 5000 by default (mapped from
> 5000:5000) on docker as well. If your device is actively using port 5000, you
> will need to remap the port on your computer to the port on Docker (the first
> number in xxxx:xxxx)


**The Database**
 Each row in the database represents an *individual* sensor reading.
 The columns per row are as follows:
 - reading_id: the (autoincrementing) id of the reading
 - sensor_id: the reading's associated CAN frame ID
 - name: the name of the sensor
 - data: the reading's associated data as seen in the CAN frame DATA field
 - unit: string representing unit of measurement for the associated reading
 - timestamp: the datetime of when the reading was entered to the database

**Notable Projects**
- RFD900 serial reader / timestamper
- SQLite db caching + retrieval
- Flask App
- sqlite file reader (Flask App)

**Notes for improvement for future years**
- Houston uses HTTP protocol by default to communicate between frontend and backend.
  This is not optimal for real-time visualization. Consider switching to UDP
